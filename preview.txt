In my preview, I have the general structure of my visual argument. It is a flyer for the class "Atoms, Molecules, and Materials." So far, I've decided to separate the space into four separate parts, each with a different color. In the four boxes, I'm planning on putting different images related to the class. The first and only image I've added is a student working in a lab. I'm planning on taking some more images of interesting diagrams and important topics in textbooks. I changed the opacity on the image so that the blue color shows through, and I'm planning on doing the same for the rest of the images. I'm not entirely settled on the colors I want to show through yet, but I think that can easily be changed based on how the final product looks. Also, I think once I have the other images from textbooks, I'll have a better idea of what color they would go well with. 

As for the text and actual name of the class, I've found some icons that I've chosen to represent various letters. The text is still in progress and I'm definitely still deciding on the font. I just added the text that are not icons as a placeholder to get an idea of what the final product will look like. I'm planning on keeping the text in the words atoms and materials, as I think they already have enough symbols and I don't want to take away from the message of the flyer. As for the word molecules, I'm planning on using shapes to create the letters so they look like the ball and stick model of molecules. The text is mainly what I focused on in class on Tuesday, and I started with all black. Now that I'm seeing the full background and text together, I'm thinking about adding a white outline to the text to make it easier to read, or making it bolder to be more clear.
