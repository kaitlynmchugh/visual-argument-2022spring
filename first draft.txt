In my first draft, I have added a few things from the preview and also changed a couple aspects of the flyer. I ended up making the size of the flyer bigger, so I could have mnore space at the bottom to include citations. I added this black space at the bottom to allow the citations to be less noticeable in the bottom corner, and I also used it to include a short description of the class or tagline of sorts. 

In class, we added the aspirational criteria of having some sort of action being taken after reading/seeing the visual argument, like scanning a QR to go to a website to get more info, fill out a survey, etc. I thought this would be a good piece to incorporate into my argument because it would help explain what the flyer is actually for without taking up more space on the flyer, or adding more text to make it more crowded. So, I added the QR to the Pitt course catalog, which includes the class number and a short description of the course, as well as who is teaching. If this flyer were actually being put to use, I think it would be a really helpful addition as classes are sometimes super hard to find just based on the name. This is just a quick way to get as much detail as possible out of the flyer about the class.

Another major change from the preview is that I've switched the text from black to white. I think the contrast of the colors in the background looks better with the white compared to the black, and I like the idea of this white being completely negative space on such a colorful background. I added the rest of the pictures into each of the four colored squares. I'm not totally set on them yet and I'm thinking about taking some more/better pictures when I get back into the lab on Wednesday. Finally, I changed the font of the word molecules to look more like the letters are individual molecules.
