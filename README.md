# Atoms, Molecules, and Materials Flyer 
An Introduction to the Synthesis and Applications of Nanomaterials 

This visual argument aims to advertise a very underrated chemistry class at Pitt, called "Atoms, Molecules, and Materials." In this class, students learn important theories and lab techniques related to nanomaterials. Students will also discover that nanomaterials are a much bigger part of our everyday life than you can imagine! Scan the QR to get more information on enrollment today.

# Reflection 

When deciding what to create for my visual argument, I was pretty overwhelmed with my options and felt that I had a lot of different concepts that I could’ve base dmy argument on, but no concrete ideas. Because of this, I decided to keep it simple and use the parachute prompt, which was to create an advertisement for a class. I had the perfect class for this, called “Atoms, Molecules, and Materials.” I thought that the name itself invoked various visuals, even when simply thinking about it (more than a class like “Organic Chemistry 2”). I knew I would definitely enjoy finding visuals and taking my own pictures for this project, as well as having a lot of material to work with, so I decided to go with this theme. 

I think I definitely met the minimum criteria for this assignment, along with some of the aspirational criteria. My argument tells the viewer to take this super fun chemistry class at Pitt, by showing them what they could be doing in the lab and learning about in books. I intended the focus of the flyer to be the text, which is the title of the course, and the background to reveal itself as the things you may do/learn about in the class. I am guiding the viewer to see what the course is, before diving into what it is about, and finally showing them how to get more information and enroll using the QR code. I think the fonts definitely match the tone, as they are sleek, bold, and scientific. Credit is given on the ad through a link to the assets file, which contains a full assets list. In this file, I have included citations for all the resources used, links, and licenses. I have used more than 3 layers, as well as more than one tool beyond select, move, and text. I altered the opacity on multiple images to create a color block effect, and I also used drop shadow to make the text stand out more. 

I knew I wanted to include some pops of color on the flyer, but I also figured having these contrasting colors so close together could be distracting. In my first draft, I simply lowered the opacity of the class images (the textbooks, the lab, and materials) but left the color blocks at their full brightness, as shown below: 
![first draft screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75503004/155591422-c5dab381-036f-494a-81df-f7b4e9fbd3b3.PNG)


After receiving the feedback shown below, I decided that lowering the opacity on the color blocks themselves could make it easier on the eyes.
![feedback 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75503004/155587734-53462d42-8436-441f-8d00-b2a6335c6342.PNG)

I included a white background behind the color blocks, so the white would show through when the color block opacity was lowered. As shown below, this helped to reduce the contrast between each color block, making it easier to read the text overall. 
![peer review screenshot edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75503004/155587775-33ce11f0-1a5b-4b85-a4a9-5d3abb31f984.PNG)

I incorporated another aspect of the feedback above into my final draft, shown here. I decided to add a drop shadow effect to the text to make it more bold on the colorful background. I think this really helps the flyer to stand out more and adds an interesting 3D aspect to it. 
![peer review screenshot edit 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75503004/155587794-ccc24b0c-c90c-4a8c-bfb1-1b749e4a43c5.PNG)

Lastly, I used non-default commit messages to help keep track of my work. 

I think some of the aspirational criteria were also met in my visual argument. I found GIMP much easier to work with after labeling my layers and grouping them into larger folders for each word in the ad. I also used 3 distinct overlapping layers. The base of my argument is the four different color blocks, covered in the images representing the class material with reduced opacity so that the color shows through, and the top layer of the text. Furthermore, I was able to use my own photography in this project. I took images from textbooks relating to the course, as well as images of one of my group members in my research lab hard at work! Lastly, I included a QR code so the viewers can get more information than can be obtained from the flyer. 

In conclusion, I feel that I successfully satisfied the baseline criteria, along with some of the aspirational goals. Coming into this project, I felt a lot less prepared in terms of ideas and skills with photoediting. As I learned more about GIMP, I was inspired to try new things and add new dimensions to my argument.

# Proposal 

For my visual argument, I will be advertising a course that I took called "Atoms, Molcules, and Materials." This was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Pitt that I don't think many people know about. I think the name definitely lends itself to a cool ad/flyer. I want to use the text of the name of the course to show all the various things you will learn about in the course. For the word "atom," I'm planning to use a model of an atom as the letter O. For the word "molecule," I'm planning to write some letters so they look like the ball and stick model of molecules, and maybe do some long carbon chains for other letters. The word materials is that part I haven't really decided on yet. I know I definitely want to turn the letter A into a ladder, with a person building something on it. For the rest of the letters, I'm just planning on having other cool materials shown in them or with them. I think the ladder and person will show that this class is relatable and the things you learn about can be applied to daily life.

# Project 2: Visual Argument / Rhetorical Collage

Your task in this unit is to **make a rhetorical claim through the juxtaposition of images and text.** It's kind of a collage, but a collage with an argument to make. In assigning this, I have two main goals for you: (1) to learn how to ethically obtain images and edit them using digital tools, and (2) to explore the affordances of still images as a medium, and especially their ability to _direct attention_ and _help make ideas memorable_.

As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, inviting someone inside, and so on. Whatever you choose, you should consider your audience and what they would find persuasive or interesting, and how you therefore wish to attract and direct their attention.

As you start planning your composition, consider: What ideas do *you* want help remembering? Or what do you want to persuade others of? Is there something you've noticed that you want to bring to the attention of others? See if any terms or images come to mind when you think of your subject, then work back and forth from image to word and back.

## Generative constraints

**Baseline Criteria** \
_to be updated in lesson 12_ \
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must…

* Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus and guide viewers' attention.
* Have a clear message or intervention that you can articulate
* If including words, choose a font that matches the style/tone of your piece
* If not using words, clarify your message and this choice in the reflection
* Credit all assets correctly, including attribution (creator names) where required
* Use at least 3 layers
* Use at least 1 tool beyond select, move, and text
* Use the reflection to clarify your compositional choices and goals (e.g. design hierarchy)
* Use non-default commit messages that say what's changing (and maybe even why)


**Aspirational Inspirations** \
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may…

* Organize your files through layer labeling, layer groups, repo structure
* Use more than 3 distinct overlapping layers
* Use more than 3 tools beyond select, move, and text that are new to you
  - e.g. Collaborate with the machine by using automated tools/filters/effects (gradients, blur, etc)
  - e.g. Use layer masks / blend modes for non-destructive extraction, saturation, cross-fades, etc
* Alter part of a source image by compositing it with another image to change its meaning (see, e.g. the [globe as ice cream](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2021spring/issues/6#issuecomment-781038538), [pillow as pill](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2021spring/issues/6#issuecomment-781522661), [ketchup as tomatoes](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020fall/issues/7#issuecomment-698522176), [ocean as carpet](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020fall/issues/7#issuecomment-698534979))
* Create your own visual assets through photography, scanned or born-digital drawing, etc
* Demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at your piece can accurately articulate your message/argument
* Demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at your piece can accurately describe your intended audience
* Try to make your design more accessible, e.g. through dyslexia-friendly fonts, color palettes designed for people with colorblindness, high contrast for people with visual impairments, etc
* Use multiple design strategies in ways that compliment each other (whether to reinforce a single shared focus or to add nuance / surprise down the hierarchy)
* Refer to assigned readings in explaining your design choices, e.g. font pairings, hierarchical levels, etc
* Be bright and bold to make your work pop and draw the eye
* Be subtle and crafty to make your work reveal itself only gradually

## Parachute Prompts

If you find yourself coming up on proposal day and you're not sure what to propose, try one of these:

1. _Illuminate a Word_. Choose one word to be the centerpiece of your canvas, and show us what it denotes, what it connotes, what associations the word brings in. Use any effects, colors, textures you want, but make sure the word itself is still legible – and don't use any other words. (This assignment is based on one mentioned by Madeline Sorapure in ["Playing Lev Manovich"](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/8.2/coverweb/sorapure/); to see examples, open that link with Firefox and jump to Automation > Examples. If Flash has died already, and no emulator is yet available – Kairos is working on it, I hear – there are also [these other examples](https://www.kid-at-art.com/htdoc/members/lesson70.html).)
2. _Advertise a Course_. Think about the classes you've taken that are under-appreciated, maybe even at risk of being under-enrolled. Create *either* an 8.5x11" print flier *or* a 16:9 ratio digital poster to be distributed around the hallways, bulletin boards, and/or tables of the university, alerting people to the awesomeness that would ensue if they enroll in that course. (You've probably seen some professors' attempts at these; they're all over the English department, at least, and on the screens in the G-level elevator lobby of the Cathedral.) Include the course title and a brief description; you can skip the date and time, or make one up.

And if your parachute is malfunctioning (e.g. you need even more specific direction), just let me know. We can probably figure something out in [office hours](http://benmiller314.youcanbook.me).
